# Axie Decentralized Governance

Axie: Infinity is a game protocol that will be progressively decentralized over time. In this project, we propose an minimum viable product for governance which can be used to prototype proposals and voting.

In Version 0.1, the project offers users the opportunity to alter variables associated to Axie body parts.

Anyone can propose changes.

Anyone can vote on any change, weighted by their MMR.
